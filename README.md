## EasyGene: Online Sequence Transcriber and Translator

### Background:

Bioinformatics applications offer robust tools for analysing genetic information. However, many of these applications are difficult to use. 

### Goals:

This application aims to provide a user-friendly web frontend for running simple genetic analysis tasks. 

### Audience:

This project targets researchers and students of biology and bioinformatics. 

### Requirements:

Users will be able to:
1. Submit DNA sequence information and transcribe or translate those sequences into:
- mRNA sequences
- Amino acid sequences
2. Authenticate using a username and password
3. Review previously submitted:
- original sequences
- transcriptions
- translations
